    Welcome to the Layton Utah Temple Openhouse
</h1>

<p>
    All are invited to come inside and see this beautiful new temple for
    themselves. <em>Open house tours are free of charge.</em>
    However, due to interest and limited space,
    we encourage you to please schedule a tour ahead of time.
</p>

<h2 class="blockquote text-center">
    "Each temple is a beacon of light and hope. The temple,
    the House of the Lord, stands as a symbol of our faith in life after death
    and as a stepping stone to eternal life for us and our families.
    The temple is a sacred and essential part of God’s plan for our happiness,
    now and forever."
